        <h1 class="q">Google obviously wanted to make its first headphones totally wireless, but couldn’t.</h1>
        <p class="q1">As such, the recent rumor about Googles plan for the Pixel Buds second generation — expected next fall — might seem surprising, but it’s really not. If Google wants to play with Apple and the other big boys in hardware, it must cement its place in the headphone lexicon. </p>

       <p class="p1">Thats doubly true since the company followed Apple in cutting the headphone jack from its Pixel 2 phone; otherwise Google is essentially throwing millions out the window.</p>
       <p class="p2">So, were doing our civic sonic duty to help Google learn from its early stumbles. Here are five things Google has to do to make the Pixel Buds 2 not suck.</p>

    <h1 class="s1">Go Fully Wireless</h1>
    <p class="s2">This is an obvious one given the competition, though also a somewhat awkward assertion given this writer’s history in calling out true wireless earbuds’ troubled past (and present, really). That said, new technology advancements such as improved Near Field Magnetic Induction (which connects earbuds through your skull) — as well as coming advancements in Bluetooth — have made it easier than ever to go wire-free.</p>
    <p class="s3">Further, the fact that Google put all its battery tech, hardware, and controls inside the big black buds themselves — instead of in the cable like so many other wireless earbuds — means Google obviously wanted to make its first headphones totally wireless, but was unable (or unwilling) to trust its skills at cutting the final connection.

<div class="s7"><p class="d1">Battery life is one of the biggest issues with true wireless earbuds. Most first-gen true wireless earbuds barely cracked the three-hour barrier per charge (if that), while the AirPods helped push the baseline to a still-mediocre five hours. It’s not easy to cram a long-lasting battery into a small pair of earbuds which require a constant electronic connection to your smartphone.</p>
    <h1 class="d2">Be The Best At Battery Life</h1>

    <p class="d5">Googles original Pixel Buds battery just matched the AirPods — even though the PBs weren’t fully wireless — and that’s just not good enough. You can bet Apple’s AirPods 2 will offer at least a modest boost in battery life, and if Google wants to make any waves, the Pixel Buds 2 need to go even further.</p>
